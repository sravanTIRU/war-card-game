# 2. Game Name and Short Description
Welcome to the War Card Game! This is a simple console-based card game where two players engage in battles and wars to determine the ultimate winner.

# 3. Game Rules
- The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.
- The deck is divided equally between two players.
- In each round, both players reveal the top card of their deck.
- The player with the higher-ranked card wins the round and takes both cards, placing them at the bottom of their deck.
- If there is a tie, a war is declared:
  - Each player places ten(10) cards face down, followed by one card face up.
  - The player with the higher-ranked face-up card wins all the cards on the table.
  - If there is another tie, the process repeats.
- The game continues until one player runs out of cards, and the other player is declared the winner.
- If the game reaches a maximum number of rounds (e.g., 500 rounds), it ends in a tie.
- I SET THE MAX ROUNDS TO 500. FEEL FREE TO MODIFY.
